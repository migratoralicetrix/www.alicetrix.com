    <h1>Setup</h1>
    <p>Setup activity is divided into two key steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1: One-Time Source and Tenant Configurations</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Step 2: Entering Admin User ID and Password for Source or Tenant each time during migration.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Step 1: One-Time Source and Tenant Configurations</strong></p>
    <p>You are required to login and go to <a href="Admin.html">Admin</a> Page for enabling this option.</p>
    <p>Source and Tenant Configuration is required to establish credentials of file migrator application with respective tenants. This establishes the fact that file migrator is an authenticated and certified application that is allowed to access contents from your Tenant.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Depending on a particular tenant File Migrator Application has options that can be enabled for establishing two modes of authentications as depicted below:&nbsp;</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>JWT Authentication&nbsp;</strong> - Allows for non-admin user ID and Password based authentication. Specific File Migrator Application is authenticated with tenant using a JSON file. (Steps for generating a JSON file is covered in respective section of each tenant).&nbsp; This mode is desirable when non-admin user can also do migration as JWT authentication gives File Migrator Application full access to Source or Destination Tenants.</li>
        <li><strong>OAuth Authentication</strong> - Allows for just in time authentication by allowing admins to login using their user Id and password. This mode requires Admin to do the migration.&nbsp;</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Step 1 or One-time Source Configuration requires an Admin user having access to Source and Destination tenant configure above options. Once either a JWT or OAuth Authentication is selected on Admin Page based on tenant respective configuration needs to be done. As mentioned earlier if <span style="text-decoration: underline;">JWT authentication is selected a JWT based JSON file is required</span> to be uploaded. If <span style="text-decoration: underline;">OAuth authentication, a new Client ID and Client Secret</span> need to be updated. Steps for Creating JSON File or Client ID/Secret pair is explained in respective tenant section.&nbsp;</p>
