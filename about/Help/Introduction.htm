    </ul>
    <p>Key Features of Alicetrix Workplace Migrator are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Multi-Threaded Environment</strong> &ndash; Contents(emails/files) of single users are uploaded read and uploaded into destination tenant through a multi-threaded program enabling simultaneous downloads/uploads hence fast migration.&nbsp; During large file migration, larger files are broken into small pieces for upload, and for each small segment of files multithreading is also done.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><strong>Starts Migrating at once</strong> and, does not create a repository of contents before migration. It builds repository while doing migration useful in case of very large data or lot of files in millions.</li>
        <li><strong>Resync-Migration Options: </strong>Multiple Migration Options are available for migrations that is first-time migration, resyncing of migration (local respository is maintianed to ensure syncing is as fast as possible).</li>
        <li><strong>Permission Migration &ndash; </strong>Ability to migrate permission using Various algorithms are available.</li>
        <li><strong>Managed failovers</strong> - Complex algorithm built to ensure failures are handled in most case automatically by the application through retrials, wait, requeuing of file transfers or auto-correction in certain cases.</li>
        <li><strong>Security with your own Cloud Infrastructure </strong>&ndash; Migrator relies on secured Microsoft Azure Infrastructure or your infrastructure for migration. Individual instance of this application are deployed through Azure Marketplace into customer&rsquo;s tenant&rsquo;s/environment. This ensures advanced security and data encapsulation which is sometimes needed for highly secure enterprise.</li>
        <li><strong>Remediation</strong>: It allows to generate reports on Source Tenant. In case of File Migration, it also corrects file names if users opt for that option, getting rid of special characters etc. (for OneDrive Destination Tenant)</li>
        <li><strong>Data Storage</strong>: Migrator relies on local database for storage of files transaction information in Web App Server itself. Local database storage ensures roundtrip in accessing database is minimized ensuring faster migration. Auto caching is enabled ensuring Database access is only done a specific period of times.</li>
        <li><strong>Auto-conversions for Google</strong>: Migrates Google Docs as well, Sheets, Images into respective file outputs.</li>
