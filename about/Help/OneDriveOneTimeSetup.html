    <h2>Step A:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to the <a href="https://portal.azure.com/">https://portal.azure.com</a>.</li>
        <li>When prompted, sign in with your administrator account credentials. This administrator should also have admin access to your OneDrive and SharePoint tenants.</li>
        <li>On Menu, left navigation pane, Go to you Azure Active Directory and click on App Registration</li>
        <li>On top, you will get option to add an app. Click on New Registration.</li>

        <li>Select under Supported Account Types &ldquo;Accounts in this organizational directory only (Migrator only - Single tenant)&rdquo;. <span class="badge badge-danger">Security Considerations</span> Be Careful in selecting any other option as that may allow Users other than current users of your tenant to have access to OneDrive/SharePoint contents of your tenant. In cases where you are migrating contents for tenants other than the one you are currently logged in, other options can be selected, but this is not recommended from security standpoint and not required as well.</li>
