    <h1>Migration</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Note: Ensure you are authenticated as per process described above before executing this step.</p>
    <h2>Migration Concepts:&nbsp;</h2>
    <h3>Name for Migration</h3>
    <p>Each time when migration is done a unique Migration Id is generated. In order to identify a Migration you can give it a name.</p>
    <h3>Entering Source and Destination mapping</h3>
    <p>Application will require a&nbsp; mapping file in CSV format to be uploaded.&nbsp; Mapping file should contain in one row Source User ID in first column and Destination account information in Second Column.</p>
    <p>Upload a comma separated file with Source and destination mapping. Source user or group (email, UPN) or URL in first column, equivalent destination user or group or URL to be represented in second column. No title or heading row required.</p>
    <p><span class="badge badge-info">SharePoint:</span> &nbsp; If using Site URL, site should be already created in destination tenant. File size less than 14 MB is accepted</p>
    <p>Multiple Source and Destination User IDs can be added as additional row in CSV file that need a migration.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For file migration, if source and destination tenants are authenticated using same User IDs you can simply enter comma separated list of user Ids requiring migration, or upload a simple comma separated csv file for user ids</p>
    <p>Below Source and Destinations are currently allowed with respective formats:</p>

    <h3><span style="font-size: 16.38px;">During Migration</span><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;</span></h3>
    <p>Migrator allows only one Migration request at a time. Hence if a Migration is in progress no other users are allowed to submit new migration request.</p>
    <p>Once Migration starts users are shown key statistics from Migration in Migration Dashboard that appears below the submit button. Migration Dashboard refreshes data by itself. It provides key metrics on current status of migration and overall progress.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Key Notes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Once User starts migration, they can close the browser if needed. If user access the migration page they can see the migration status.</li>
        <li>It is not recomended, however a User can wish to stop the migration. Option to stop the migration appears after migration has started. Please allow for approx 5 mins wait after cancellation before starting a new migration to allow for any database commits etc. to occur. Use concepts of sync migration for migrating same set of users again.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>If Migration has finished, detailed reports of migration can be retrieved from the reports tab. User can retrieve details of migration from reports tab when Migration is in progress, however it is not recommended for performance reasons as it retrieves data from the same database.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
