    <h3><strong>Syncing Email migration&nbsp;</strong></h3>

    <div class="form-group">

        <p><div class="custom-control custom-checkbox"><strong><label class="custom-control-label" for="justReadforRemediation">Check if this is a Sync migration</label></strong></div></p>
        <p>Keep this checkbox on as default unless target/destination tenant has no mails in the mailbox. If destination is empty, this option can be unchecked to enable a faster first pass migration.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This option is used for Sync Migration to ensure mail items that are already migrated are not duplicated in Source Tenant.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>System creates a local database for all migrated emails to check emails in that database first before attempting to write email in destination mailbox. System also checks source tenant if email was not found in database before migrating mail item if this option is checked.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><div class="custom-control custom-checkbox"><strong><label class="custom-control-label" for="justReadforRemediation">Check to enable read mode only. This can be used for reporting purpose.</label></strong></div></p>
        <p>This checkbox can be turned on if actual migration is not intended. In this option System just mimics the migration process and generates reports on all mail items and mail folder that needs to be migrated. Give a suitable name to this migration to ensure they can be separately reported or pulled out from reporting tab.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hence in this option, no emails are migrated from source account, source mailbox details are reported, destination is just checked for proper authorization, and availability of requisite accounts and folders in mailbox. Use Reports tab for detailed list of items to be migrated.</p>
